This is the source to tvsp 0.1a.  By: Lok Tai (Andy) Fung

Included is:

1) the Server (DI_Evenonly plugin for DScaler 4)

2) TVSP SDL version for the PC (debug purposes)

3) TVSP SDL version for the PSP (actual program)



1 and 2 can be compiled using Visual Studio .NET. 1, 2 and 3 requires 
the SDL and the jpeglib libs for compilation. Enjoy, I can not
provide any support for the source code.
