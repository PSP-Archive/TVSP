The latest version is always at

   www.afung.com/tvsp



TVSP is the premier free Location Free TV viewer.

* Watch TV anywhere with a wifi connection.
* Allows channel changes.
* by the way, no sound yet. I'll get on it next time I have some free time. It's not a bug.



Description:

    Basically, you can watch TV on your PSP anywhere with a wifi connection. TVSP
receives the TV signal from a TV capture programmed called DScaler. And the best of all,
it doesn't cost $350 to get TV on my PSP :-)



Controls:

    Press [UP] or [DOWN] to change channel.
    Press [START] to quit. *** Please QUIT this way only, not by press Home ***.



Background Story:

    How did I come up with TVSP? Hmmm, it was one day in my bathroom to take a load off :-)
When all of a sudden, omg, I have forgotten to bring anything in to entertain myself. Not a 
Maxim magazine in sight. What have I done??? While being quite bored, I had an epiphany. 
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I can watch TV in the can. The rest is history.



Installation Directions:

It's not very hard, it's actually quite simple. Just follow the directions "EXACTLY" and
you'll be watching tv on your psp in no time. You do need a TV Card though. I have a 
ATI TV Wonder VE, and it works great. Any TV card that works with DScaler 4 is good.

1) Download DScaler 4 from   
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/deinterlace/DScaler4115.exe

2) Install DScaler 4 and set it up. You can find help at  
    http://www.dscaler.org

3) copy the special "DI_EvenOnly.dll" file from TVSP.RAR and copy it into the DScaler 4
installation folder (default folder:  "C:\Program Files\DScaler4\"  ). It will overwrite
the original DL_EvenOnly.dll.

4) Run DScaler 4, and make sure to set menu BTCard->PixelWidth to 320. You have to do 
this before the next step or it might crash or what not!

5) Select menu "Deinterlace" to "Even Scanlines Only". Now the Server DLL is running.

6) Edit TVSP.ini and put in the IP address of the computer you are running DScaler.

7) Run TVSP on the PSP and volia, you're wirelessly watching TV. Enjoy.


If all else fails, just watch the video at www.afung.com/tvsp. If you exhausted all
your options, and you still want to try to get it to work, and continued to
persevere, you can email me with exact details of what you did and what is wrong at:

Suggestions are welcome. Sure...why not.



Developer Notes:

Initially I was going to use VLC instead. Somewhere along the line, it was just easier
to do this with DScaler instead for some technical reason. At a later date, I will add
sound support and perhaps a better interface if time permits. Probably if I stopped
developing this app for a month, I'll just release the source. Just ask if a month
elapsed and I haven't done squat. Btw, the server's port is 8888 if anyone needed to
configure their routers for serving TV over the internet.


Special thanks to:
my gf for the idea of using the name TVSP. How original eh?
